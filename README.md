# Django, Webhooks and Natural Language Processing for Making a Responsive WhatsApp Chatbot
<p align="justify">The adoption of chatbots was accelerated in 2016 when Facebook opened up its developer platform and showed the world what is possible with chatbots through their Messenger app. Google also got in the game soon after with Google Assistant. Since then there have been a tremendous amount of chatbot apps built on websites, in applications, on social media, for customer support, and countless other examples. A chatbot are software applications that use artificial intelligence & natural language processing to understand what a human wants, and guides them to their desired outcome with as little work for the end user as possible. This project uses Python, Flask, Django and various other frameworks to code and build two different functioning chatbots. One serves as a chatbot which allows the user to have a conversation while the other is more sophisticated being that it is chatted on WhatsApp and can return famous quotes, news article and images of specific animals. The paper explains what chatbots are and how this technology may be used by a business to become more efficient and collect more data.</p>

    "## What Are Chatbots\n",
    "Chatbots are software applications that use artificial intelligence & natural language processing to understand what a human wants, and guides them to their desired outcome with as little work for the end user as possible. They can act as a virtual assistant for all user experience touchpoints.\n",

    "A well designed & built chatbot will:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Use existing conversation data (if available) to understand the type of questions people ask.\n",
    "    Analyze correct answers to those questions through a ‘training’ period.\n",
    "    Use machine learning & NLP to learn context, and continually get better at answering those questions in the future.\n",
    "    \n",
    "At the highest level, there are three types of chatbots most consumers see today:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Rules-Based Chatbots – These chatbots follow pre-designed rules, often built using a graphical user interface where \n",
    "    a bot builder will design paths using a decision tree.\n",

    "Flask offers suggestions, but doesn't enforce any dependencies or project layout. It is up to the developer to choose the tools and libraries they want to use. There are many extensions provided by the community that make adding new functionality easy. The code is instantiating a Flask object by passing __name__ argument to the Flask constructor. The Flask constructor has one required argument which is the name of the application package. Most of the time __name__ is the correct value. The name of the application package is used by Flask to find static assets, templates and so on."

    "The app and chatbot can be ran and tested with ```django-admin manage.py runserver``` command. This starts a lightweight development Web server on the local machine. By default, the server runs on port 8000 on the IP address 127.0.0.1. Although an IP address and port number can be explicitly passed. The development server automatically reloads Python code for each request, as needed. The server does not need to be reset for code changes to take effect. However, some actions like adding files don’t trigger a restart, so the server does need to be reset in those cases. When the server is started, and each time the Python code is changed while the server is running, the system check framework will check the entire Django project for some common errors (see the check command). If any errors are found, they will be printed to standard output.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Chatbots can be extremely helpful for businesses who might not have the resources to answer each customers questions or concerns every minute of the day with a live agent. If the chatbot is trained well it can substitute a human for frequent questions and answers and can always be programmed to direct the customer to a live representative when the chatbot is not able to answer adequately. The technology is easy to build up from and with the amount of replies and chats large companies have with their customers everyday, their AI chatbots are able to train with new conversations. \n",
    "\n",
    "At an individual level, chatbots are interesting and fun and can clearly be used to improve productivity. They can be asked to fetch news, images and even complete automated tasks.\n"
